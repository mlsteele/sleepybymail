# Sleepy By Mail

I was getting really tired at work because I didn't have the discipline to go to sleep at a reasonable time.
This thing is here to help analyze the effect of that lack of sleep.
This thing emails me every day asking how many hours of sleep I got and then a few more times during the day to ask me how tired I am.

## Dependencies

Gotta have Mongo, pymongo, sendgrid, and flask.
(And a SendGrid account.)

## Usage

Run logserver.

Use `sendmorning.py` to send the daily morning email.

Use `sendcheckup.py` to send the occasional status check.

To automatically send emails, see `crontab` for an example.
You will need to customize it to fit your rig.

## Components

A triggered script sends emails to the user.
The user clicks links in the email which hitting a log server.
The log server logs events to mongo.

I use cron to trigger the scripts `sendmorning.py` and `sendcheckup.py`.
Both of which use `sendbase.py` to send a message generated by `messages.py`.

The log server is an http server that notices when a link has been clicked and logs the attributes to mongo.
The log server is a flask app in `logserver.py`.

`quickieconfig.py` is also cool. See its comments.
