# Sleepy By Mail

I was getting really tired at work because I didn't have the discipline to go to sleep at a reasonable time.
This thing is here to help analyze the effect of that lack of sleep.
This thing emails me every day asking how many hours of sleep I got and then a few more times during the day to ask me how tired I am.

## Dependencies

Gotta have Mongo, pymongo, and flask.

## Usage

Run logserver.

Use sendmorning.py to send the daily morning email.

Use sendcheckup.py to send the occasional status check.
